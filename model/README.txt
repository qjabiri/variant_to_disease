Overview
The final_model4.py script is part of a larger project focused on the analysis of genomic data. This script is the culmination of model development efforts, evaluation on the dataset.
Script Details
final_model4.py
* Purpose: This Python script implements model designed to analyze genomic data. It handles tasks such as data loading, preprocessing, and possibly making predictions.
* Key Features:
   * Loads and preprocesses genomic data from specified sources.
   * Returns the processed mutations similar between an individual's genome compared to that of the master datasets.






Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Required Python libraries (install using pip):
   * csv
   * sys
   * os
Usage
1. Prepare Data: Ensure that the input data is in the expected format and located in the specified directory. Adjust paths in the script if necessary.
Run the Script: Execute the script from the command line to start the training and evaluation process:
bash
